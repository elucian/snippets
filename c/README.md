## Programming C

We study C and take notes so you do not have to. Our notes are publicly available on this very repository, free to read without adds and intreruptions. You can find description of these examples from this repository on our wiki pages so you can learn C.  

## Language Review

C language is the root language for C++ and Objective-C. Its syntax is derived from B language also developed at Bell-Labs. In next video I mention C language and C++ languages. These two languages are very different, though the name du not suggest so.  My recommendation about learning this language may surprise you.

You can clone this repository and test out these examples. Some examples have comments and most of these example can be run on https://repl.it. After you finish please contact us on Reddit and post an article about your learning experience. Then maybe you can contribute with more complex examples that could be useful for learning C programmming.
