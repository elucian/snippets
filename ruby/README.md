## Programming Ruby

These are examples of Ruby programs available for study. You can find description of these examples on our wiki pages. We study Ruby and take notes so you do not have to. Our notes are publicly available on this very repository, free to read without adds and intreruptions. 

## Language Review

Ruby uses English keywords, and is not a curly bracket language. The syntax is more verbose than other languages but very readable once you get use to it. After you learn Ruby you should also learn RoR that is Ruby on Rails. This is a Model View Controller (MVC) framework for website design.

## Learning Ruby

Learning Ruby is a happy adventure. There are very fiew true Ruby developers, and the onse who really know Ruby are about to retire. THere are projects that must be maintained and there are no people for doing this job. Though Ruby is a mature language it is regarded as oldish. I personaly believe that learning Ruby is a good investment. I was able to learn Ruby syntax in 7 days.
