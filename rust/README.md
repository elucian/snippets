## Programming Rust

These are examples of Rust programs available for study. You can find description of these examples on our wiki pages. We study Rust and take notes so you do not have to. Our notes are publicly available on this very repository, free to read without adds and intreruptions. 

## Language Review

As I have presented in the video Rust language is trade-safe system language. There are companies who are switching to Rust to replace parts of operating systems and drivers. Therefore Rust language can no longer be ignored by system developers. In the future more and more companies will chose Rust over C or C++.
